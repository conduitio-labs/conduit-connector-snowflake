| T3204407 | Create the Snowflake source with "snapshot":"false" ("also 0", "f", "F", "false", "FALSE", "False")-> data that was added before starting the pipeline will not be transferred (if add data during pause, data will be transferred after restarting) | Passed |                                               |
